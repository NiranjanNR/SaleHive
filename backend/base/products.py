The mixture is kneaded and then left to rise, allowing the yeast to ferment and produce carbon dioxide gas, which causes the dough to expand. The risen dough is then shaped into loaves, rolls, or other forms, and baked in an oven. Bread is a versatile food that can be enjoyed in many ways, such as as a side with meals, as a sandwich, or even as a dessert with toppings like butter and jam. There are countless varieties of bread, from white bread to sourdough to pumpernickel, each with its own unique flavor and texture."},
